## Basics of Github

Pull changes:
`git pull`

If you run into issues because you have local changes, you'll want to open a new branch and push your changes to it:
`git checkout -b "my-branch-name-without-space"`

Add changes to the branch:
`git add .` Adds the whole current folder
`git commit -m "A simple commit message explaining proposed changes"` Adds a commit of your current files to the branch
`git push` Pushes your new branch to the main repo
